# WGS QC Pipeline

A snakemake pipeline for performing QC on WGS VCF files. Includes QCs for Minor Allele Frequency (MAF), Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), Relatedness, and Missingness (sample and SNP). Takes in a gzipped vcf file.

Based on script in Adelson et al. 2019

Currently version: 1.0

# Command

source snakejob [path to config.yaml]

# Config Options

File Configs

*inFolder*: Folder where input files are located

*outFolder*: Folder where final output is stored

*interFolder*: Folder where intermediate files are stored. These are files such as relatedness, missingness, and other metrics.

*statsFolder*: Folder where stats are stored.

*gzvcf_suffix*: Suffix for gzipped vcf file. Used to extract file names.


QC Metrics

*MISS_THRESH_SNP*: Threshold of missingness of a SNP, above which we exlude SNP from analysis. Default is 0.15

*ODP*: Overall Read Depth. Default is 25000

*MQ_MIN*: Mapping Quality lower threshold. Default is 58.75

*MQ_MAX*: Mapping Quality upper threshold. Default is 61.25

*VQSLOD*: Filtering criteria applied only to SNVs. Default is 7.81

*GDP*: Genotype level read depth. Default is 10.

*GQ*: Genome Quality. Default is 20.

*Inbreeding Coefficient*: Default is -0.8

*MISS_THRESH_INDI*: Threshold of missingness of a Sample, above which we exclude Sample from analysis. Default is .1

*RELATEDNESS_THRESH*: Threshold of relatedness, above which we exclude a Sample based on relation to other Samples. Default is .125
