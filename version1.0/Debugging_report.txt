#Note1: I don't think MAF makes sense for triallelic+ sites. I'm not sure about HWE, but I wouldn't think so either. Handle these at the end of the filters
#Skip InbreedingCoeff for now because I need to merge before performing that
#Include paper's default values in my config file
#adjust sample1 and sample2 to params.sample1 and params.sample2

#Error1: String manipulation in the beginning of the code. Used quotes around a variable making it a strings
#Error2: real regex needs an escape character for . after "chr"
#Error3: input cannot use variables from params. Put all rules within for loop so it performs rules on all files without doing combinations of file names
#Error4: as a result, params.sample1 -> sample1, and same for sample2
#Error5: Rule to combine chromosomes also needs wildcards specified
#Error6: Input is looking for double forward slash as a result of improper string parsing
#Error7: Combine biallelics use a looping mechanism that isnt allowed in snakemake. Concatenate as a work around
#Error8: Also, the forward slashes are causing some unexpected file parsing behavior. Evaluate
#Error9: Several semicolon, comma, and underscore missing characters fixed.

#Error20: Tabix file is older than original gzipped? Doesn't make much sense since the tabix is created after the vcf.gz. Read while pipeline is running
#Error21: No idea about the previous, but maybe its encountering an error because of bgzip overriding its own output file? Investigate
#Error22: Filter5's output is extremely small. It seems that its a result of Filter4's parameter for Overall Real Depth for Variant. 25000 is much too large for our current data. I'm going to go with 5000 for now
#Error23: Tabix times are consistent. My guess is that bcftool stats goes in and changes the time on the file. Do all tabix after stats
#Error24: Tabix error persists. Using touch command to artificially change timestamps to force it to work. Comment this in the script
